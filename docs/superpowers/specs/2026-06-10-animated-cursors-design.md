# Animated cursors (RENDER CreateAnimCursor) — design

**Date:** 2026-06-10
**Status:** approved scope: KMS v2 backend only
**Branch:** `feat/anim-cursor`

## Problem

RENDER `CreateAnimCursor` (opcode 31) is handled in
`crates/yserver-core/src/core_loop/process_request.rs:1880-1960` as a
*static degeneration*: the frame list is parsed and validated, but the
new cursor permanently inherits the FIRST sub-cursor's host handle.
Delays are ignored. Users see a frozen first frame instead of a
spinner (`left_ptr_watch`, busy cursors during app launch, etc.).

## Goal

Real frame cycling on the KMS v2 backend (the dogfooding target),
honoring per-frame delays. ynest keeps the current static-first-frame
behavior unchanged (explicit decision 2026-06-10; revisit later if
needed).

## Non-goals

- ynest animation (host-forwarding) — deferred; ynest is explicitly
  not a priority (decision 2026-06-10). Known pre-existing gap there,
  unchanged by this work: the degenerated anim cursor *aliases*
  frame 0's host handle while the host-X11 backend forwards real
  `FreeCursor` (`host_x11/request.rs:242`) — a client freeing its
  sub-cursors (the standard libXcursor pattern) leaves the anim
  cursor's handle stale on the host. If ynest ever matters, the fix
  is forwarding RENDER CreateAnimCursor to the host via the new
  trait method.
- Per-device animation state (Xorg keeps anim state per
  `DeviceIntPtr`; yserver has a single effective pointer cursor).
- Drift-corrected absolute scheduling — spinners don't need it.

## Reference: how Xorg does it

`render/animcur.c`: an animated cursor stores `nelt` ×
`AnimCurElt { pCursor, delay_ms }`. The `DisplayCursor` screen-proc
wrapper detects an animated cursor becoming current, shows frame 0,
and arms an OS timer. The timer callback displays
`(elt + 1) % nelt` via the *unwrapped* DisplayCursor and returns the
next frame's delay (self-rearming). Constituent cursors are
refcounted (`RefCursor`) so the client may free them after creation.
`ProcRenderCreateAnimCursor` (`render/render.c:1783`) errors:
`BadLength` on odd request length, `BadValue` on zero frames,
`BadCursor` on unknown sub-cursor, `BadMatch` on nested animated
cursors.

## Design

### Architecture choice

Backend-internal animation, driven by the existing
`Backend::next_wakeup()` deadline that already feeds the core loop's
poll timeout (`core_loop/run.rs:409-437`). The KMS backend already
owns effective-cursor resolution (`refresh_effective_cursor`,
`kms/v2/backend.rs:1122`), the HW cursor-plane upload path, and the
scene cursor registration — animation is a backend concern there.

Rejected alternative: core-driven ticking (core stores frames, calls
`define_cursor` per tick). More Xorg-shaped and would extend to ynest
for free, but core does not know which cursor is *effective* — that
knowledge lives in the KMS backend — so it would need new plumbing
for no benefit at the approved scope.

### New backend trait method

```rust
/// RENDER::CreateAnimCursor. `frames` pairs each sub-cursor's host
/// handle with its delay in ms. Returns the new animated cursor's
/// handle, or None when the backend does not animate (caller falls
/// back to static degeneration on frame 0).
fn create_anim_cursor(
    &mut self,
    _origin: Option<OriginContext>,
    _frames: &[(CursorHandle, u32)],
) -> io::Result<Option<CursorHandle>> {
    Ok(None)
}
```

Default impl returns `None` → the existing handler path (first
sub-cursor's handle) stays as the fallback. ynest and the recording
backend need no changes.

### Request handler change

`process_request.rs` CreateAnimCursor handler keeps the existing
id-ownership and sub-cursor-exists checks, then calls
`backend.create_anim_cursor(...)`. On `Some(handle)` store that as
the cursor's `host_xid`; on `None` keep today's first-frame path.

Two validation gaps to close while here (today's handler returns a
silent `Handled` for both — `process_request.rs:1922-1928`):

- empty frame list → `BadValue` (Xorg: `ncursor <= 0`,
  `render.c:1801`); list length not a multiple of 8 bytes →
  `BadLength` (Xorg: odd `req_len`, `render.c:1796`).
- a sub-cursor that is itself animated → `BadMatch` (Xorg refuses
  nested animated cursors, `animcur.c:316`). The core resource
  table does not currently track animatedness, so the core `Cursor`
  resource (`resources.rs:2142`) gains an `anim: bool` flag, set on
  **every** successful CreateAnimCursor — on all backends, including
  when the backend returned `None` and the cursor degenerated to
  frame 0. The handler checks the flag on each sub-cursor; no
  backend round-trip. This means ynest now also rejects nested
  animated cursors with `BadMatch` where it previously accepted
  them — a deliberate protocol-fidelity fix (Xorg rejects them),
  distinct from the "ynest keeps static rendering" non-goal.

### KMS backend: data model

Namespace note (these are different `u32` spaces — do not mix):
client cursor *xids* live in the core resource table, which maps
them to backend-allocated *host handles* (`CursorHandle`). All KMS
cursor maps — `cursor_records`, `cursor_pixmaps`,
`effective_cursor_xid` — are keyed by **host handle** raw values
(`kms/v2/backend.rs:274-278`). Everything below is in host-handle
space; "handle" means host handle.

```rust
pub(crate) struct AnimCursorRecord {
    /// Frame snapshots taken at creation time: the frame's record,
    /// its sprite pixmap (what the scene samples in SW-cursor
    /// mode), and its delay.
    pub(crate) frames: Vec<AnimFrame>,
}

pub(crate) struct AnimFrame {
    pub(crate) record: std::sync::Arc<CursorRecord>,
    /// `None` when the sub-cursor's sprite alloc was skipped or
    /// failed (Vk-less fixtures; rare production alloc failure) —
    /// mirrors `insert_cursor_record`'s best-effort
    /// `cursor_pixmaps` insert. On display, a `None` frame REMOVES
    /// the anim handle's `cursor_pixmaps` entry (never leaves a
    /// stale prior-frame pixmap for the SW path to sample); the
    /// display helper then early-returns on the missing entry, so a
    /// `None` frame skips display (HW upload included) for that
    /// tick. Records/serials still advance.
    pub(crate) pixmap: Option<crate::kms::v2::store::DrawableId>,
    pub(crate) delay: std::time::Duration,
}
```

Stored in a new `anim_cursor_records: HashMap<u32 /*handle*/,
AnimCursorRecord>` beside `cursor_records` / `cursor_pixmaps`. The
animated cursor also gets entries in `cursor_records` and
`cursor_pixmaps` pointing at frame 0's record/pixmap so every
existing "static cursor" code path (effective-cursor walk, XFixes,
scene registration) works untouched for frame 0.

`create_anim_cursor` impl: look up each sub-cursor handle in
`cursor_records` (missing → `io::Error`; insert nothing on partial
failure) and `cursor_pixmaps` (best-effort `Option`, see
`AnimFrame.pixmap`), clone the Arcs/ids, allocate a fresh handle the
same way `create_cursor` does, insert all three maps.

Frame lifetime: KMS v2 keeps the trait's default no-op `free_cursor`
(`trait_def.rs:944`) for animated handles too — backend-side cursor
records and sprite pixmaps are never freed (status quo). This is
deliberate, not an omission: window/root cursor bindings store raw
host handles (`backend.rs:92,10052`), and core's `FreeCursor` removes
only the resource-table entry — a freed animated cursor can still be
bound and *effective*, and per X11 semantics (Xorg refcounting) it
must keep displaying — and keep animating — until unreferenced.
Eagerly removing the maps would strand the effective cursor on
missing entries. The no-op gives the keep-alive half of Xorg's
refcounting for free; the missing release half is the same
pre-existing leak static cursors already have — out of scope.

Delay of 0 ms is clamped to 16 ms. **Explicit Xorg deviation:** Xorg
stores 0 as-is (`animcur.c:359`) and lets the timer re-fire
immediately; in our deadline-driven loop a 0 delay would make
`next_wakeup()` return `now` forever — a poll busy-spin. 16 ms ≈ one
display frame; no client-visible behavior difference at that rate.

### Animation state (one active animation)

```rust
struct ActiveCursorAnim {
    handle: u32,         // animated cursor (host handle) cycling
    frame: usize,        // current index
    next_frame: Instant, // deadline for the next advance
}
```

One `Option<ActiveCursorAnim>` on the backend — matches the
single-effective-cursor model.

- `refresh_effective_cursor()` resolves the effective cursor; if its
  handle has an `AnimCursorRecord`, set/replace `ActiveCursorAnim`
  (frame 0, `now + delay[0]`). If the effective cursor is not
  animated, clear it. Re-resolving to the *same* animated cursor must
  NOT restart the animation (Xorg: "already current → do nothing");
  only a change of effective cursor handle resets to frame 0. (The
  existing early-return at `backend.rs:1125` when the handle is
  unchanged already gives this.)
- Client `FreeCursor` of the animated cursor does NOT stop a running
  animation: the binding-by-host-handle survives resource-table
  removal, and X11 semantics keep an in-use cursor alive (see Frame
  lifetime in the data model section). The animation ends when the
  effective cursor changes, like any other cursor.

### Frame tick

- `next_wakeup()` (`kms/v2/backend.rs:8217`) additionally chains
  `ActiveCursorAnim.next_frame` — but only when outputs are active
  (see gating below). This bounds the core loop's poll timeout
  (`run.rs:409-437`) so the loop wakes by the deadline.
- **Concrete tick site:** there is no generic "deadline fired"
  backend callback after poll; the only unconditional per-iteration
  backend hook is `maybe_composite()` (`run.rs:741`). The tick runs
  at the top of `maybe_composite()`, *after* its existing
  `scanout_allowed()` / `kms_outputs_active` gates — which gives the
  DPMS/VT gating below for free: if `now >= next_frame`, advance
  `frame = (frame + 1) % n` and display the new frame (below), then
  re-arm `next_frame = now + delay[frame]` (relative re-arm,
  self-heals after a stall; if multiple deadlines were missed while
  stalled, advance once — do not fast-forward through missed
  frames).
- **Displaying a frame** mirrors the tail of
  `refresh_effective_cursor()` **including the sample-view readiness
  guard at `backend.rs:1139-1148`** (Vk-less fixtures build records
  without sprite allocations — the headless unit tests below walk
  straight into this path), for the new frame's record + pixmap:
  update `cursor_records[handle]` and `cursor_pixmaps[handle]` to
  the frame's entries (keeps XFixes and any other reader
  frame-correct), then — readiness permitting — scene
  `register_cursor(CursorEntry { id: frame.pixmap, .. })` (SW path
  samples the pixmap — updating the record alone would leave SW
  compositing on frame 0) and `queue_steady_state_cursor_upload()`
  when in Hw/Mixed plane mode and ≤64×64. Factor this shared tail
  into a helper rather than duplicating it.
- **Version/serial:** XFixes' `ActiveCursorImage.serial` is
  contractually monotonic (`trait_def.rs:71-74`), and the upload
  path dedups on version. Reusing each frame record's own version
  would repeat `v1,v2,v3,v1,…` on wraparound — backwards. Each tick
  therefore mints a **fresh** version from the same monotonic
  counter that stamps new `CursorRecord`s, and passes it as
  `record_version` / upload version / XFixes serial. The frame
  records themselves stay immutable. Mechanically: the tick inserts
  `cursor_records[handle] = Arc::new(CursorRecord { version: fresh,
  ..frame.record's fields })` — a ≤16 KiB clone per tick for HW-size
  cursors — so every reader picks up the minted version with no new
  branches.

### DPMS / VT gating

Frame ticks and uploads are gated on `kms_outputs_active` and
`scanout_allowed()` exactly like `maybe_composite` (EINVAL-storm
lesson, 2026-05-30): while outputs are off or VT is switched away,
`next_wakeup()` does not report the anim deadline (no wakeups burned
on an invisible cursor) and no uploads happen — `next_frame` is
simply left in place. On wake/VT-return the stale deadline is in the
past, so the first loop iteration advances **one** frame immediately
(the no-fast-forward rule above) and re-arms from `now`; normal
cadence resumes from there. No reset hook needed.

### XFixes GetCursorImage

Must return the *current frame* with a monotonic serial (Xorg
behavior). The KMS paths that serve cursor images out of
`cursor_records` (`kms/v2/backend.rs:4167,14030,14390`) read the
animated cursor's `cursor_records` entry — which the tick replaces
with the current frame's bytes under a freshly-minted version (see
Frame tick). No XFixes-specific changes needed.

### Error handling

- Handler validation errors: `BadCursor` for unknown sub-cursor
  (unchanged); new `BadValue` for an empty frame list, `BadLength`
  for a non-multiple-of-8 list, `BadMatch` for nested animated
  cursors (see Request handler change).
- `create_anim_cursor` backend failure (sub-cursor record missing —
  "can't happen" after handler validation): the handler logs a
  warning and degenerates to the static first frame (same
  swallow-and-degrade shape as the existing RENDER CreateCursor
  opcode-27 dispatch). The backend guarantees no partial map state
  on failure (insert only after all lookups succeed).

## Testing

1. **Unit (KMS backend, no display):** existing test harness at
   `kms/v2/backend.rs:16476+` style —
   - create 3 cursors, create anim cursor → `cursor_records[anim]` /
     `cursor_pixmaps[anim]` are frame 0; `next_wakeup()` includes
     the deadline.
   - simulate tick past deadline → frame advances, wraps mod n,
     `cursor_records[anim]` and `cursor_pixmaps[anim]` follow.
   - **serial monotonicity across wraparound:** versions strictly
     increase over ≥ 2n ticks (the regression Codex flagged: naive
     Arc-swapping repeats `v1,v2,v3,v1`).
   - **SW path:** the `CursorEntry.id` registered with the scene
     changes to each frame's pixmap across ticks (not just the
     record bytes).
   - effective cursor switches away → anim cleared, `next_wakeup()`
     no longer reports it; switch back → restarts at frame 0;
     re-resolve to same cursor → frame index preserved.
   - client FreeCursor of the anim cursor while it is effective →
     animation keeps running (keep-alive-while-referenced); next
     effective-cursor change ends it cleanly.
   - sub-cursors freed after creation → frames still cycle
     (backend-side records survive; status-quo no-op free).
   - nested-anim `BadMatch` also on a `None`-returning (fallback)
     backend — the `anim` flag is core-level.
   - delay 0 clamped to 16 ms.
   - handler errors: empty list → `BadValue`; odd pair bytes →
     `BadLength`; nested anim cursor → `BadMatch`.
2. **vng smoke (iteration signal, not release gate):** small xcb
   test client that builds a 2-frame anim cursor with visually
   distinct frames + 200 ms delays and sets it on a window; verify
   visibly cycling. `left_ptr_watch` via a busy GTK app as a
   real-world check.
3. **HW dogfood (bee, MATE):** busy cursor during app launch spins;
   DPMS off/on while spinner active → no EINVAL storm, animation
   resumes. HW runs coordinated with the user per the established
   tmux procedure.

## Risks

- HW cursor plane re-upload cadence: a memcpy per frame at 30–100 ms
  is negligible, but the upload path was built for rare cursor
  changes — watch for log spam or per-upload allocations; the
  version-dedup mechanism must not treat alternating frames as
  "unchanged".
- Three maps keyed by the same host handle (`cursor_records`,
  `cursor_pixmaps`, `anim_cursor_records`) must stay in sync on
  create and tick (same discipline as the existing sibling-map
  comment at `backend.rs:277`; nothing is removed on free — see
  Frame lifetime).
- The per-tick record clone (fresh-version mechanism) allocates;
  bounded at cursor size (≤16 KiB HW, larger for SW cursors) per
  frame at 30–100 ms cadence — acceptable, but keep it out of any
  hotter path.
